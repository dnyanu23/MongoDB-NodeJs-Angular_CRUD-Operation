# MongoDB-NodeJs-Angular_CRUD-Operation
A CRUD operation using MongoDb as backend and Node.JS as middleware for API requests and Angular 20 for FrontEnd processing.

In here there are 2 project which run individually, 1st Project is in Node.JS which take care of API and Database connection with MongoDB.
Node.Js is use to create a business layer where we write our CRUD functionalities.
2nd Project is in AngularFrontEnd folder where we worked on front end part
After extracting the project we need to treat both project differently and get latest "node_module" folder using "npm install --save" commands.
